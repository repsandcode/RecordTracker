  <h3 class="text-normal  italic leading-6">We are grateful for the grand privilege to "Go ... and make disciples of all the nations". (Matt. 28:19, 20) However, the end of this system of things is getting closer each passing day. But until the very end, we are determined to keep returning to those interested, watering the seeds of truth that we have planted. (1 Cor. 3:6-9) <br> Therefore, we strive to maintain an organized record of each individual.</h3>
